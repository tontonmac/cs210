Memo
The recursive solution uses both more memory and more processing time than an iterative solution.
1)In your own words, compare the design of the iterative method with the design of the recursive method.  
What equivalent things are happening and where do they happen in each solution?

In the recursive and iterative methods we have to have a base case. in this case, we compare the
size of the triangle to the smallest triangle.


the recursive drawTriangle method calls itself, while in the iterative version, 
we have to iterate through the entire stack and pop the triangles while the stack is not empty.


2)Why did the iterative version of your Applet produce the same drawing with a Stack and also with a Queue?  
Explain what did happen differently when you used a Queue instead of a Stack.

Because both the stack and the queue iterate through a list of element and display the containt.
I did not notice any difference when i used either the stack or the queue until when i run it.
the applet closed when i run the stack version but when i use the queue version, in order for me to 
close the applet window, i have to reset the compiler.
