   Memo

1. The Big-O notation is O(N).

2. We can use both HashMaps and TreeMaps. TreeMap is an example of a SortedMap, 
   which means that the order of the keys can be sorted, and when iterating over the keys,
   you can expect that they will be in order.

   HashMap on the other hand, makes no such guarantee. Therefore, when iterating over the keys of a HashMap,
   you can't be sure what order they will be in. HashMap will be more efficient in general, so we use it whenever
   we don't care about the order of the keys.

3. yes we can built treemap instead of hashmap, we will just need to sort the list in the treemap and in the 
   hashmap we dont need to sort it.
